# -California-Housing-Data-Analysis-

🏡 California Housing Data Analysis 🏡
📑 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing housing data from the California Housing dataset. The primary aim is to extract insights related to housing prices, locations, and demographics using Python and data manipulation libraries. The analysis provides valuable information about real estate trends in California, using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to execute the analysis.

# 🔧 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following software and libraries installed:

# Python 3.x 🐍
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab 📓

Pandas for data manipulation 🐼

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization 📊

NumPy for numerical operations 🔢

Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks 🧠

You can install the necessary libraries with the following command:

# pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn

🚀 Steps for Task Execution
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment ⚙️

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab can be used for this project. If you are using Google Colab, upload the california_housing_test.csv file.
For Google Colab:

# from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
Step 2: Loading the Dataset 📂
Import necessary libraries and load the California Housing dataset:

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('california_housing_test.csv')

# Display first 5 rows
data.head()
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Conduct EDA to understand the structure of the data. Start by summarizing key statistics and checking for missing values:
python
Copy code
# Basic info about the dataset
data.info()

# Summary statistics
data.describe()

# Check for missing values
data.isnull().sum()
Step 4: Data Visualization 📊
Visualize the distribution of housing prices and other key variables. For example, plot housing price distribution:
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Distribution of Median House Values
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['median_house_value'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Median House Values')
plt.xlabel('Median House Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
Step 5: Feature Engineering 🛠️
Create new features from existing ones, such as population density or bedrooms per household:
python
Copy code
# Example: Adding a new feature for population density
data['population_density'] = data['population'] / data['households']
Step 6: Building a Machine Learning Model 🤖
Use Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on the features in the dataset. Start by splitting the data into training and testing sets:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = data.drop('median_house_value', axis=1)
y = data['median_house_value']

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Train a regression model:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Initialize and fit the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Evaluate the model:
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Predicting on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculating RMSE
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}')
Step 7: Saving the Results 💾
Save the processed dataset or model predictions for future use:
python
Copy code
# Save processed data
data.to_csv('processed_california_housing.csv', index=False)

# Save model predictions
predictions = pd.DataFrame({'Predicted': y_pred})
predictions.to_csv('housing_predictions.csv', index=False)
Step 8: Conclusion ✅
Summarize the findings and the results of the model evaluation. For example:
Median house values show a strong correlation with the median income in each block.
The Random Forest Regressor yielded a RMSE of X, which indicates how well the model performed.
🎯 Future Work
Improving Model Performance: Try using other models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Geographical Analysis: Map out housing prices geographically using latitude and longitude data.
Feature Selection: Perform feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors.
🏆 Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive overview of how to handle and analyze housing data, with a focus on the California Housing dataset. The analysis included exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the use of a machine learning model for predicting housing prices.
